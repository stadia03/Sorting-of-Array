# Array sorting 


Hello!

This Program can sort your array using two effective and distinguish methods, also in ascending or descending order.

Bubble sort 

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order.
Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

Selection sort 

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

So moving back to our program, first it provides option to choose between methods of sorting.

Then after choosing the preferable method of sorting it ask you for the order to sort

Next, it ask for maximum elements to sort, then it ask for elements as input, then using the algorithms it sorts the array and output the result.

Also using a while loop I made the program continuous so you donâ€™t have to run it again and again.
Lastly a thankyou note was printed.
