Hello!
This Program can sort your array using two effective and distinguish methods, also in ascending or descending order.
Bubble sort 
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

Selection sort

So moving back to our program, first it provides
